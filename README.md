Myntra was founded in 2007 by Mukesh Bansal, Ashutosh Lawania, and Vineet Saxena as a venture to sell personalized gifts. However, in 2010, the company shifted its focus to retailing branded apparel, and the rest, as they say, is history. Myntra made strategic tie-ups with famous brands and started retailing their latest and top-selling merchandise. The company soon expanded its portfolio to include international and high-end brands and ventured into the lifestyle section. Today, Myntra sells over 500 Indian and international brands, making it a one-stop-shop for fashion-conscious Indians.
